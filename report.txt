📘 Project Report
EcoReceipt – Environmental Impact Analyzer
1️⃣ Project Overview

EcoReceipt is a sustainability-focused receipt analysis system that extracts product information from uploaded receipt images and evaluates their environmental impact.

The system performs:

OCR-based text extraction

Product name cleaning and parsing

Fuzzy matching against a sustainability database

Environmental impact scoring

Alternative product recommendation

Dashboard visualization

PDF improvement guide generation

The goal of Phase 1 was to build a structured, modular, scalable system capable of evolving into a production-grade sustainability intelligence platform.

2️⃣ Problem Statement

Consumers are often unaware of the environmental impact of their daily purchases.

Receipts contain valuable behavioral data, but:

They are unstructured

OCR text is noisy

Product names vary

Impact information is not directly available

This project solves:

Automatic receipt understanding

Sustainable product scoring

Actionable eco-friendly suggestions

Architecture design principles used:

Separation of concerns

UI layer separate from logic layer

Core logic modularized

Future ML-ready structure

Container-ready

5️⃣ Core Components
🔹 OCR Engine (core/ocr_engine.py)

Uses Tesseract OCR

Extracts text from receipt images

Designed to support future ML OCR replacement

🔹 Parser (core/parser.py)

Cleans noisy OCR text

Removes irrelevant lines

Extracts probable product names

🔹 Scorer (core/scorer.py)

Uses RapidFuzz for fuzzy product matching

Maps detected products to database entries

Returns:

matched product

impact score

category

greener alternative

impact reason

🔹 Database (core/database.py)

Loads products.csv

Acts as sustainability reference dataset

Designed for future migration to PostgreSQL

8️⃣ Engineering Lessons Learned

During Phase 1:

Cloud deployment complexities (import paths)

System dependency management (Tesseract)

Docker-based containerization

Clean repository structuring

Git hygiene

Modular architecture design

This project moved from prototype to structured engineering design.

9️⃣ Limitations (Phase 1)

Rule-based impact scoring

Static CSV database

No persistent storage

No user tracking

No real emission dataset integration

OCR accuracy dependent on image quality

🔟 Future Scope (Phase 2 & Beyond)

Planned improvements:

🚀 ML Integration

Replace rule-based scoring with ML model

Predict CO₂ emissions per product

Train using real environmental datasets

🚀 Database Upgrade

PostgreSQL integration

User purchase history tracking

Analytics dashboard

🚀 Backend API Layer

FastAPI service

REST endpoints

Separate frontend/backend

🚀 Cloud Infrastructure

Railway / Render / Docker deployment

Scalable container orchestration

🚀 Sustainability Intelligence Expansion

Carbon footprint calculation

Category-level analytics

Behavior trend tracking

1️⃣1️⃣ Resume Summary

EcoReceipt is a modular sustainability analysis system that demonstrates:

OCR-based document processing

Fuzzy text matching

Data pipeline architecture

Impact scoring logic

Clean dashboard visualization

Containerized deployment design

It reflects structured engineering thinking rather than simple UI experimentation.
